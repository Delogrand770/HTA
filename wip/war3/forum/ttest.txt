Wow. You guys post more than I do. You all get an entry in the 'Credits' section :D

I don't understand why you said: "The chance of getting it is 2%". The chance of getting what? 

I meant the chance of drawing 'Last Wish' for each drawn card, but 2% isnt quite right... so nvm! 

People: If you could get more than 1 strength in the game and more than 20 HP all cards would be less good. So a maximum is really 1/20 ok!? 

More than one creature? That is like too much variety in game play. One is totally enough. 

My opinion: 
Add a 'Change Creature' option in the menu (maybe in the 'Options' section). Creatures must be unlocked. Each creature has one special attack which is bound to the creature. 

2500 Z is maybe enough for 1 HP (buy in shop behind the gamble card), because you need money for boosters. 

There will be already 3 slots for 3 different decks. I dont want 3 slots for creatures, because you can change them by hand. 

Changing creature cards does only change the creature graphic & special ability - not the STR/HP. 

So morphing only for one battle? And 0  ? I am ok with that. 

I will of course make more rankings (also to unlock  ) including new bosses and in general new creatures to morph. 

Remark: 
Each deck includes now one 'Morph' card for you guys having fun with it. 

If I include all this stuff, maybe I have to make the multiplayer part on page 3. Or an extra program. Hmm?
