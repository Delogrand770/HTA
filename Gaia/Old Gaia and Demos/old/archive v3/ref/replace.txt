replace(/\r|\n|\r\n/g,"") - use to remove carrage returns from a string.



Definition and Usage
The replace() method is used to replace some characters with some other characters in a string.

This method supports regular expressions. You can learn about the RegExp object in our JavaScript tutorial.

Syntax
stringObject.replace(findstring,newstring)  

Parameter Description 
findstring Required. Specifies a string value to find. To perform a global search add a 'g' flag to this parameter and to perform a case-insensitive search add an 'i' flag 
newstring Required. Specifies the string to replace the found value from findstring 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tips and Notes
Note: The replace() method is case sensitive.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1 - Standard Replace
In the following example we will replace the word Microsoft with W3Schools:

<script type="text/javascript">

var str="Visit Microsoft!";
document.write(str.replace(/Microsoft/, "W3Schools"));

</script>  

The output of the code above will be:

Visit W3Schools!  

  

Note: In the following example the word Microsoft will not be replaced (because the replace() method is case sensitive):

<script type="text/javascript">

var str="Visit Microsoft!";
document.write(str.replace(/microsoft/, "W3Schools"));

</script>  

The output of the code above will be:

Visit Microsoft!  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 2 - Case-insensitive Search
In the following example we will perform a case-insensitive search, and the word Microsoft will be replaced:

<script type="text/javascript">

var str="Visit Microsoft!";
document.write(str.replace(/microsoft/i, "W3Schools"));

</script>  

The output of the code above will be:

Visit W3Schools!  

  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 3 - Global Search
In the following example we will perform a global match, and the word Microsoft will be replaced each time it is found:

<script type="text/javascript">

var str="Welcome to Microsoft! ";
str=str + "We are proud to announce that Microsoft has ";
str=str + "one of the largest Web Developers sites in the world.";

document.write(str.replace(/Microsoft/g, "W3Schools"));

</script>  

The output of the code above will be:

Welcome to W3Schools! We are proud to announce that W3Schools
has one of the largest Web Developers sites in the world.  

  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 4 - Global and Case-insensitive Search
In the following example we will perform a global and case-insensitive match, and the word Microsoft will be replaced each time it is found, independent of upper and lower case characters:

<script type="text/javascript">

var str="Welcome to Microsoft! ";
str=str + "We are proud to announce that Microsoft has ";
str=str + "one of the largest Web Developers sites in the world.";

document.write(str.replace(/microsoft/gi, "W3Schools"));

</script>  

The output of the code above will be:

Welcome to W3Schools! We are proud to announce that W3Schools
has one of the largest Web Developers sites in the world.
